    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The recipe of Penne alla vino is quite an easy one, i for one do not know how to make Penne alla vino so i will<br> just make up stuff as i go. Truely how hard can this be "burp"</p>
    <p> Allirght let me take one last big sip before we actually start doing this.<br> Couldn't you just use chatgpt to make it instead of looking at this project?</p>
    <p>Ok so here is a ordered list or whatever you want "burp"</p>
    <!-- not actually an ordered list, in fact it is an unordered list -->
    <ol>
        <li>like a lot of cheese and stuff</li>
        <li>Two bottles of wine</li>
        <li>one big ass tomato</li>
        <li>oh alomost forgot, also like penne or whatever it is called</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Oh you are still here? grrreatttttt. Alright lets do some steps i guess. <br>Because my ingredients weren't speaking for themselves enough already sigh:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ok so open the first bottle of wine and chug it. That's a good start to numb the suffering.</li>
        <li>Next throw the tomato in the pan or whatever you are using, im not the police.</li>
        <li>Top the tomato with the whole packet of Penne alla vino you bought</li>
        <li>Ah yea and uhh cheese. Throw half in and chug the other half.<br>Right about now would be a good time to look at that second bottle of wine</li>
    </ol>
